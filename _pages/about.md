I'm a second year postgraduate student from [Southern University of Science and Technology](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/). My research interests lie in the connection between stable homotopy theory and algebraic geometry. Particularly, I'm interested in elliptic cohomology theories, and spectral algebraic geometry. I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yifei Zhu](https://yifeizhu.github.io/) of [Department of Mathematics](https://math.sustech.edu.cn/?lang=en), SUSTech. I was an undergraduate in physics department of [Sichuan University](https://en.scu.edu.cn/).You can find my [CV](https://552jc.github.io/ljc552.github.io/assets/CV.pdf) here.
