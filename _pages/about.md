I am a second year postgraduate student from [Southern University of Science and Technology](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/)(SUSTech), fortunately advised by [Prof. Yifei Zhu](https://yifeizhu.github.io/) of [Department of Mathematics](https://math.sustech.edu.cn/?lang=en). I am interested in homotopy theory and algebraic geometry. 

My CV is available [here](https://552jc.github.io/ljc552.github.io/files/resume.pdf).
