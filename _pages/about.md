I am a first-year Ph.D. student at [Johns Hopkins University](https://mathematics.jhu.edu/), commencing in the Fall of 2024 under the supervision of Professor David Gepner. My research interests lie in homotopy theory, higher algebra, and algebraic geometry. Previously, I completed my Master's degree at [Southern University of Science and Technology](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/)(SUSTech) under the guidance of Professor [Yifei Zhu](https://yifeizhu.github.io/). Prior to that, I obtained my undergraduate degree in physics from Sichuan University.

My CV is available [here](https://552jc.github.io/ljc552.github.io/files/resume.pdf).
