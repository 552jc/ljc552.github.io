I'm a second year postgraduate student from [Southern University of Science and Technology](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/). My research interests lie in the connection between stable homotopy theory and algebraic geometry. Particularly, I'm interested in elliptic cohomology theories, and spectral algebraic geometry. I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yifei Zhu](https://yifeizhu.github.io/) of [Department of Mathematics](https://math.sustech.edu.cn/?lang=en), SUSTech. I was an undergraduate in physics department of [Sichuan University](https://en.scu.edu.cn/).You can find my [CV](../assets/CV.pdf) here.

A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository.
