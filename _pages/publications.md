My research interests lie in the connection between stable homotopy theory and algebraic geometry like chromatic homotopy theory, elliptic cohomology theories, and spectral algebraic geometry. Specifically, I'm interested in the (E_infty)orientation from Thom spectra, higher algebra, and spectral moduli problems.
