My research interests broadly lie in the connections among stable homotopy theory, higher algebra, algebraic geometry and tt-geometry, like chromatic homotopy theory, elliptic cohomology. 

Specifically, I am interested in orientations from Thom spectra, rewritings of stable homotopy theory by higher algebra, reformulations of chromatic homotopy theory by spectral algebraic geometry (SAG), spectral moduli problems, and higher algebra in t-structured tensor triangulated $\infty$-categories.

Preprints
======
<!--* __<u>Dualizable additive $\infty$-categories</u>__ (joint with [Vova Sosnilo](https://vova-sosnilo.com/index.html); in progress)<br>   -->
* __<u>Unification of Zariski, Balmer and smashing spectrum</u>__ (joint with [Changhan Zou](https://people.ucsc.edu/~czou3/); in progress)<br>We introduce a general Zariski frame functor to unify Zariski, Balmer and smashing spectrum. We introduce the notion of $\Sigma$-triviality for a pointed $\infty$-category, which allows the quotient by an ideal in it. We show that the $\Sigma$-trivialization of the \infcat of spaces is a mode. 
* [Higher algebra in $t$-structured tensor triangulated $\infty$-categories (Draft)](https://552jc.github.io/ljc552.github.io/files/HA_ttt_draft.pdf)(joint with Xiangrui Shen; Comments Welcome!)<br>Many concepts from higher algebra—such as finitely presented, flat, and étale morphisms of $\mathbb E_\infty$-rings—can be naturally generalized to the setting of $t$-structured tensor triangulated $\infty$-categories ($ttt$-$\infty$-categories).
    Under a natural structural condition we call ``projective rigidity'', we establish analogues of Lazard’s theorem, étale rigidity, and the universal property of the derived category. We show that projective rigidity holds in many familiar examples, including the $\infty$-categories of spectra, filtered spectra, graded spectra, genuine $G$-spectra for finite groups $G$, and Artin–Tate motivic spectra over a perfect field—all equipped with their standard $t$-structures.
<!--  * __<u>$\infty$-macrotopoi</u>__ (in preparation)<br> Lars Hesselholt and Piotr Pstrągowski introduced the notion of ∞-Macrotopoi in the appendix of Dirac Geometry II. It provides an excellent categorical framework--large enough to encompass a rich class of geometric objects while remaining not too large and well-behaved, making it an ideal setting for addressing fpqc sheafification, and perfectly incorporating SAG's geometric stacks and even condensed mathematics. We will develop more and prove some basic properties of $\infty$-macrotopoi such as Giraud’s axioms. */  -->

Besides, we also introduce how to generalize the Thom spectrum functor into any presentably symmetric monoidal $\infty$-category, by using the universal property of Picard $\infty$-groupoids.

And we will see that the Brauer group $\operatorname{Br}(\mathbb{S})$ of the sphere spectrum is zero using the spectral sequence involving the etale cohomology by Antieau–Gepner's work in 2012.

Notes

<!-- * [Copointedlization and costabilization](https://552jc.github.io/ljc552.github.io/files/Sp_fin.pdf)<br>A concrete model of costabilization -->
* [Elliptic cohomology theories and the $\sigma$-orientation](https://552jc.github.io/ljc552.github.io/files/sigmaorientation.pdf)<br>Ando-Hopkins-Strickland found a special orientation from $MU\langle 6\rangle$ to elliptic cohomology theories, called $\sigma$-orientation. In this note we will give both topological and algebro-geometric settings of $\sigma$-orientation. Furthermore, we will introduce the precise definitions of formal groups, line bundles on a formal group, and particularly the $n$-connective cover of an $E_{\infty}$-space, which seems not well-described in ordinary references.
* [Postnikov-type convergence in $\infty$-categorical framework](https://552jc.github.io/ljc552.github.io/files/convergence.pdf)<br>Lurie introduced an $\infty$-categorical framework for the postnikov tower in a presentable $\infty$-category in his HTT. Here we will generalize it to the case of any ascending sequence of reflective full subcategories in an $\infty$-category.
* [The Right Adjunction of Thom spectrum Functor](https://552jc.github.io/ljc552.github.io/files/thomsp.pdf)<br>A specific description of the right adjoint functor to Thom spectrum functor, which is given by the total space of a fiber bundle with fibers infinite loop spaces.
* [Notes on elliptic curves and abelian varieties](https://552jc.github.io/ljc552.github.io/files/Ellabvar.pdf)<br>This note will provide an introduction to formal groups, elliptic curves and abelian varieties. We first how to get a natural formal group from a smooth group variety. Second we prove that any elliptic curve admits a natural structure of group variety by a technique about relative effective Cartier divisor. After that, we introduce étale-local decomposition and the quotient scheme. In the last chapter we will see that elliptic curves are exactly abelian varieties of $\operatorname{dim}=1$ and that any abelian variety is automatically commutative, smooth and projective. Furthermore we can see that the group structure on an abelian variety is unique under a prescribed unit.
