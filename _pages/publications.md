My research interests lie in the connection between stable homotopy theory and algebraic geometry like elliptic cohomology theories, spectral algebraic geometry and chromatic homotopy theory. Specifically, I'm interested in the (E_infty)orientation from Thom spectra, the unit of E_infty rings, and spectral moduli problems.
