My research interests broadly lie in the connection between stable homotopy theory and algebraic geometry like chromatic homotopy theory, elliptic cohomology theories, and spectral algebraic geometry. Specifically, I am interested in the (E_infty)orientation from Thom spectra, reinterpretations of chromatic homotopy theory by formal algebraic geometry, and spectral moduli problems.
