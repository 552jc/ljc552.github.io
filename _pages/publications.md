My research interests broadly lie in the connection between stable homotopy theory and algebraic geometry like chromatic homotopy theory, elliptic cohomology theories, and spectral algebraic geometry. Specifically, I am interested in the (E_∞)orientation from Thom spectra, reformulations of chromatic homotopy theory by formal (spectral) algebraic geometry, and spectral moduli problems.
