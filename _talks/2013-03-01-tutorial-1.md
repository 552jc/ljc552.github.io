We first introduce formal rings and how to get a natural formal group from a smooth group variety. Second we prove that any elliptic curve admits a natural structure of group variety by
a technical method of relative effective Cartier divisor. After that, we introduce some basic properties of group scheme, Ã©tale-local decomposition of algebraic groups and the quotient scheme by an action of group scheme. Thirdly we introduce abelian varieties, we will see that elliptic curves are exactly abelian varieties of dim = 1 and that any abelian variety is automatically commutative, smooth and projective. In addition we will see that the group structure is unique on an abelian variety given a basepoint. Finally we will study isogenies between abelian varieties.
